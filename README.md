<h3 align="center">NFT SWAPPER</h3> 
<p align="center">Peer to peer exchange of multiple NFTs for EVM chains</p>
 
When you want to exchange one or more NFTs with another person, so that you give them yours in exchange for them giving you theirs, the first person to send them needs to trust that the second person will do so as well. NFT Swapper solves this problem by using the contract as an intermediary, so that you can only claim each other's NFTs when you have both deposited yours.

The contracts listed here do not charge any commission, they are free to use. They also have no owner or administration mechanisms so everything is controlled by the user.

### Guide
* Create a new swap agreement by registering owners, NFT contract addresses and the token IDs.
* Owners of NFTs must approve as operator the Swapper contract address on the NFT contracts.
* Both owners have to deposit their NFTs in the swap agreement.
* One owner can claim the swap and both receive the other's NFTs.
